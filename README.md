# What is this branch?

This repo was originally created so that Quantellia could explore Reactive controls that could be applied to CDDs in Causal Decision Models.  
They ultimately created an example that included a complete working simulation for a complex real-world CDD, using fully bespoke rendering and simulation.

This branch was created to explore how OpenDI could go about generalizing these controls, integrating them with more general-purpose JSON Schema definitions for controls. It evolved into a working in-browser react-based decision engine.

Much of the code in this branch will move to OpenDI's CDD Authoring Tool repo once licensing on the original controls is settled.
